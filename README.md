Introduction:

This example demonstrates the concept of Middleware in ASP.NET Core and how it works. Middleware is a fundamental part of building modern web applications, handling incoming HTTP requests before they reach the Controller and allowing for various operations such as performance logging, authorization, rate limiting, and more.

What is Middleware?

Middleware is a software component that is placed in the request processing pipeline. Each Middleware performs a specific task, such as logging the request execution time or verifying that the user has the necessary permissions to access a specific resource. The Middleware pipeline consists of several ordered components, through which the request passes sequentially.

How does the Request reach the Middleware?

When an HTTP request arrives at an ASP.NET Core application, it is passed through the Middleware pipeline. Each Middleware receives the Request and HttpContext (which contains information about the request), can perform specific operations, and then pass the request to the next Middleware in the pipeline using await _next(context). If the request is not passed to the next Middleware, it means that the current Middleware has finished processing the request.

Key Uses of Middleware:

Profiling: Measuring the time taken to execute each request.
Authentication/Authorization: Ensuring that users have the necessary permissions to access specific resources.
Rate Limiting: Preventing users from sending too many requests in a short period.
Error Handling: Intercepting errors that occur during request processing and displaying appropriate error messages.
Modifying the Request or Response: Adding or modifying request or response headers.
Example Explanation:

This example contains two types of Middleware:

ProfilingMiddleware: Logs the time taken to execute each request. It uses a Stopwatch object to measure the time and then logs the duration in the application log using ILogger.

RateLimitingMiddleware: Controls the rate of requests. It allows a maximum of five requests within a specified time period (10 seconds in this example). If the user exceeds this limit, a "Rate Limit Exceeded" message is displayed.

In the Program.cs file, the Middleware is added to the processing pipeline using app.UseMiddleware<>(). Note the order in which the Middleware is added, as RateLimitingMiddleware is executed first, followed by ProfilingMiddleware. This means that RateLimitingMiddleware will be executed before ProfilingMiddleware.

Conclusion:

Middleware is a powerful tool in ASP.NET Core for performing various operations before the request reaches the Controller. Middleware can be used to perform tasks such as performance logging, authorization, rate limiting, and more. Middleware is arranged in a request processing pipeline, through which the request passes sequentially.
